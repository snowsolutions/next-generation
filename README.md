## Architecture

This project will be decorated in the `\src`. I tend to leave the `\app` as default.

### Entities
The `Entities` is the protagonist in Hexagonal architecture, or somewhere they reference it as the `Application`. We use the pluralized term `Entities` or `Entity` in this project to build all business logic around the `Entity`.This section present for all business logic implemented across the application.

The `Application` code will interact with the `Infrastructures` through `Interactors`, `Contracts` and `Repositories`. We can safely assume that `Contracts` and `Repositories` are `Ports` and `Adapters` in Hexagonal architecture.

### Infrastructures

The `Infrastructure` section present for technologies that implemented across the application, which is the `Laravel` framework in this case. The section contains anything that coupled to the infrastructure and separated from the application code.

### Integrations
The `Integrations` section present for third parties that integrated across the application, which is the `Salesforce` platform in this case. The section contains all required classes to create the integration between the application and Salesforce like: API Clients, Request Objects, Response Objects, Services, Exceptions
